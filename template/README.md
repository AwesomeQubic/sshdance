# SSHDance template

I used crane as a base, and then build upon it, big credit to crane for doing most of the heavy lifting...

I also included `.envrc` and stuff that builds oci images for this... Now hit the ground running

THO expect breaking changes

Also do `git init` on project root

# Lastly get some good beat and start coding it up!
