# SSHDance

So here is a small networking lib made by me that **hopefully* will make it a bit easier to make ssh sites...

I do not like being overly formal so if you want to see an example of it working look at `examples/intro`. There probably be a branch in this repo titled `qubic-experimental` or something that I will push changes I'm making to SSHdance for my site...

So have fun
