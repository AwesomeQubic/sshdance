# SSHDance

So here is a small networking lib made by me that **hopefully* will make it a bit easier to make ssh sites...

I do not like being overly formal so if you want to see an example of it working look at `examples/intro`. There probably be a branch in this repo titled `qubic-experimental` or something that I will push changes I'm making to SSHdance for my site...

Have fun and may meme driven development be with you

## I want to help develop this lib

Well great tho look at the root of this project you see a file called `flake.nix`?

If yes then great, its a file used to build environments using `nix` package manager and should get us to use same compiler and everything, so I politely ask you to either use NixOs or get standalone nix to work on this project

## I have nix now what do I work on?

Well here is a list of my current TODOs:

 - Nix templates so we do not have to bother people with getting this lib to work
 - Better input handling
 - Make this more formal
